# Copywriting — Onette Berlin

One-page cafe site. Copy is inline in `src/pages/index.astro` using `<span class="lang-en">` / `<span class="lang-de">` pairs. Source content: `about-onette.md`, `menu.md`, `testimonials.md`, `quotes.md` in project root.

## Voice

Casual, warm, playful, confident. Like a friend who makes incredible food and always has a good bottle open. Humor is on — puns are part of the brand ("Sandwiched between choices", "Lettuce eat salad!").

**Do:** Short sentences, sensory language, "come as you are" energy.
**Don't:** Corporate/techy, trend hype, fine-dining pretension, unverifiable superlatives.

## Bilingual Rules

EN and DE are **not translations** — each should feel native.

- **EN:** Direct, casual American English. Puns welcome.
- **DE:** "International Berlin German" — informal (du/ihr), keep common English loans (Walk-ins, Comfort Food, Cold Brew). Don't force-translate puns: "Lettuce eat salad!" → "Salat-Ecke".
- Menu item names stay English if that's the brand name.

## Tone Benchmarks (from press)

- **CeeCee:** "feels as if it has always been there... serving exactly what is often missing" → timelessness, belonging
- **tipBerlin:** "urig und zeitgenössisch zugleich" → rustic + contemporary duality
- **Mit Vergnügen:** "satt, glücklich und garantiert mit Lust auf einen zweiten Besuch" → satisfaction, return visits
- **Berlin Food Stories:** "brings together the best American diner culture and classic German café vibes" → cultural blend
- **Jaeger und Sammler:** "US-Diner-Vibes treffen auf Häkelgardinen und Spreewaldgurken" → playful contrast, unexpected harmony

Aim for: familiar yet new, neighborhood yet quietly special.

## Section Guidance

- **Hero:** One feeling, not an explainer. Short.
- **Info strip:** Facts only (hours, address, walk-ins, card). No marketing.
- **About:** Emotional heart. 2-3 short paragraphs max.
- **Menu:** Punchy names, 1-2 sentence descriptions (taste/texture first). Include allergen codes.
- **Wine/Evening:** Warmer, more intimate register. Don't oversell.
- **Testimonials:** Direct quotes — never modify. Link to originals.
- **Footer:** Minimal. No marketing copy.

## Verified-Only Policy

**Safe:** Name, Tamara & Brie, address (Grunewaldstraße 11, 10781 Berlin), hours (Tue-Sun 10-15, Thu-Sat 15-22), walk-ins only, card accepted, est. 2024.
**TBD — never state as fact:** Email, awards, ratings, dietary claims, takeaway, accessibility, events.
